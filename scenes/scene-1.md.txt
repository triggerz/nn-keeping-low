# Description

At a joint management meeting for the entire CVP area, your manager's leader, Anita, asks how you - as managers - are experiencing the general mood in the building at the moment. You currently have many frustrated employees due to understaffing, lack of storage space and unexpected downtime. You are experiencing an emerging blame culture instead of collaboration.  However, nobody says anything at the meeting. What do you do?

# Choice
Nothing, like your colleagues. 

# Variables

 - bringoutthebest-engage-healthywork: 0.1

# Feedback
Since everybody else is choosing this option - why shouldn't you? However, you have current issues that you can share to help shed light on the situation. Next time - don't hesitate: Speak up. 

# Choice
You share the current challenges in your own team. Your colleagues must speak for themselves.

# Variables
 - yourself-authentic-rolemodel: 0.9
 - yourself-influence-drivemotivation: 0.9

# Feedback
Speaking up is great as it is important to share your opinions. In this situation you share what you know is going on in your own team. This may help start an important discussion in the group of leaders about the general mood in the building.

# Choice
You express your perception of the general mood in the building - explaining that employees and managers seem frustrated. 

# Variables
 - yourself-authentic-rolemodel: 0.7
 - yourself-influence-drivemotivation: 0.9
 - bringoutthebest-engage-healthywork: 0.4

# Feedback
Speaking up is great. Anita was asking for your opinion. At this moment in time perhaps you should just express current issues and experiences in your own team. That is your expertise and solid knowledge. 

# Choice
You talk to Anita after the meeting in a more private setting and express your perception of the situation. 

# Variables
 - yourself-authentic-rolemodel: 0.6
 - yourself-influence-drivemotivation: 0.7
 - bringoutthebest-engage-healthywork: 0.2

# Feedback
This could be a good option. Make sure to speak up when your opinion is asked for. It's fine if you prefer doing this in a more private setting. However, speaking up during the meeting also enables you to share your opinions within the management team, which could be constructive.
